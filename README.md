# Assignment: R Functions and Working with Census Data

This assignment deals with functions and census data exercises.

Please "fork" this repository so that you have a copy under your own Github account, allowing you to commit changes and push them. You'll know you've successfully forked the project when instead of my Github user name you see your own before the repository name itself.

Once you've forked the project, "clone" it without RStudio as a new project, as we've been doing. You'll then be ready to work.

The assignment file itself is a Quarto document in this repo (`Rassignment_functions_census_yournamehere.qmd`). *Rename* the assignment file you're using to put *your own name as part of the file name*.

During the course of your work on the assignment, make a *minimum of three "commits"* with corresponding commit messages describing your progress. You can make more if you so choose, but make at least three commit snapshots.

When you are finished, *make sure you have "pushed"* your latest version up to your Github repo from within RStudio. Then *submit on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.gwu.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_12593697_1&course_id=_373171_1&group_id=&mode=cpview) the URL* to your repo.
